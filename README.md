# This is a GUI interface built that provides convenient access to
# an OCR system designed to identify text in a photo and provide that
# text back to the user. The user may also see the various stages of processing 
# done on the image as well as the stages in which the tensorflow model
# identifies characters in the image.

# This project was done for 4317 -- Intelligence Systems for Engineering at Cal Poly Pomona
